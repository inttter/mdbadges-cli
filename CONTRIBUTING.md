# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering making a contribution to this project! Take a moment to read through the guidelines below before making your contribution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have Node.js 18 or higher installed before contributing.

# Installing locally

Firstly, you will need to have a local copy of the repository.

To do this, fork the project locally by clicking the '**Fork**' button at the top of the repository to create a fork of mdbadges-cli to your GitHub account.

You'll then need to clone the fork on your local machine. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
# Replace 'YOUR-USERNAME' with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mdbadges-cli.git
cd mdbadges-cli
```

Then, create a branch to work on your changes:

```bash
# Replace '[NAME]' with the name of your branch
git checkout -b [NAME]
```

You can now start making your changes. Once you are ready to to commit your changes and push them to remote, run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ feat: [commit message here]"
git push
```

> While not explicitly required, it's recommended to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification for commit message. If you would like, you can also use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) or any other emoji spec for commit emojis.

You can now create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes.

# Commands

mdbadges-cli uses [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) for commands. In order to add a new command, follow the steps outlined below:

**1.** Navigate to the [main file](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/src/index.mjs) where all of the commands are defined in.

**2.** Define the new command, specifying a **name**, **alias(es)** (optional), a brief **description** of its purpose, and the command logic itself.

```js
program
  .command('example')
  .alias('eg')
  .alias('ex')
  .description('An example description for the docs.')
  .action(() => {
    // Put your command logic here...
    console.log(c.cyan('Something happens here.'));
  });
```

Generally, you should stick to single-word command names. For example, instead of naming the command **'command-name'**, name it **'command'** instead.

You should also try to keep command names and descriptions **concise and descriptive** to avoid any confusion to users.

# Adding Badges

Before you contribute a new badge, make sure that you have checked for the following:

* Badge is not a **duplicate**
* Badge is in the **correct category**
* Badge is listed in the category in **alphabetical order**
* Badge image appears **without any issues**
* Badge code works **without any issues**
* [Badge has a **logo**](https://github.com/inttter/md-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#license)
* Badge follows the **correct format**

Once you have verified all of the above, you have two ways that you can add badges.

### Adding directly to JavaScript

If you want to directly add a badge into this repository, follow the steps below.

**1.** Navigate to the [file](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/src/badges.mjs) where badges are stored and defined in.

**2.** If you are adding a badge to an existing category, locate the relevant category for the badge, and add the definition for the badge in **alphabetical order**, like this example below:

```javascript
'social': {
  'deviantart': // ...
  'discord': '[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](#) ',
  'facebook': // ...
}
```

* `'discord'` is the **definition** of the badge.

* `[![Discord]` is the **alternate text** of the badge.

* `https://img.shields.io/badge/...` is the **badge link**.

* `(#)` is where the badge would take a user when clicked. Make sure this stays as `(#)`, and **do not add your own links within this part**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that your badge uses the correct format (as shown above) in order for it to pass the [badge validation test](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/tests/validate.test.js).
>
> You can check if your badge passes the test by running:
>
> ```bash
> npm run test
> ```

If you are adding a new category, ensure it the category is placed in **alphabetical order** as well, and update the [category table](README.md#categories) in the README with the name and syntax of the category.

### Adding to Markdown file (md-badges)

You can also add a badge to [md-badges](https://github.com/inttter/md-badges), where every badge you can use within mdbadges-cli comes from. To add it, you can:

* Navigate to the repository for md-badges via the link above.
* Read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/inttter/md-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
* Contribute a new badge to that repository.

When badges are added to md-badges, they will be added accordingly to this package in future releases, usually within a few days or weeks.

# Styling

In mdbadges-cli, `Chalk` is the main coloring package that is used. To use Chalk, use the `c` prefix, followed by the [color option(s) of choice](https://github.com/chalk/chalk?tab=readme-ov-file#styles).

  ```javascript
  // Examples
  console.log(c.green.bold('\nBadge found:'));
  console.log(c.hex('#FFBF00').bold(`${selectedBadge}\n`));
  ```

While there are no set colors you should or should not use, aim to keep consistency with colors of other commands.
