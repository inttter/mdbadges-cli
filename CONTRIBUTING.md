# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Take a moment to read through the guidelines below before making your contribution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Node 18 or higher is required.

# Features

If you would like to contribute a new feature, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/pulls), detailing the feature and additional information, such as what it does, and its use case.

For commands, read below.

## Adding Commands

The [**Commander**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) package is used for creating new commands.

To add a new command:

**1.** Navigate to the ```/src/index.js``` file, where all the commands are written.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Ensure that any new command code is placed above this line to ensure proper functionality:
> ```javascript
> program.parse(process.argv);
> ```

**2.** Define the new command, specifying its name, aliases (optional), a brief description of its purpose, and the command logic itself.

You can view an example command below:

```javascript
  program
  .command('example')
  .alias('ex') // can be more than one
  .description('Outputs some text in different styles.')
  .action(async () => { // command logic goes below
   // note: you can use a different action
    console.log(gradient.cristal("This will be outputted with a gradient!"));
    console.log(chalk.hex('#FFBF00')("This will be outputted with the hex color!"));
    console.log(c.yellow.underline("This will be outputted in yellow, while being underlined!"))
  });
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to use single-word command names without spaces (e.g. instead of ```search-badges```, do ```search```). **Aim to keep command names concise and descriptive.**

While commands can be added anywhere within the file, it's recommended to place them at the bottom of the file *(but above the process.argv line)*. This arrangement makes it easier to manage and update commands in the future.

# Adding Badges

When adding badges, you have two options to do so.

### 1. Adding directly to JavaScript

If you want to directly add a badge into this repository, follow these steps:

**1.** Navigate to the ```src/badges.js``` file, which contains the definitions for the badges.

**2.** If you're adding a badge to an existing category, locate the relevant category for the badge, and add the badge definition in alphabetical order, like this example below:

```javascript
'social': {
  // other badges...
  'discord': '[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](#) ',
}
```

```'discord'``` - **Name of the badge** *(what users will type when typing the command to find a badge)*

```[![Discord]``` - **Alt Text** *(preferably, should be the same as the badge name)*

```https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white``` - **Badge Link**

```(#)``` - Where links that redirect to other pages will go

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DO NOT** place anything other than (#) in the section after your link. This is for the ```mdb create``` command and the ```--link``` option in the main command.

### 2. Adding to Markdown file

If you want to  add a badge to the list of badges, follow these steps:

**1.** Navigate to the [**md-badges repository**](https://github.com/inttter/md-badges).

**2.** Read the [**contributing guidelines**](https://github.com/inttter/md-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.

**3.** Contribute a new badge to that repository.

**4.** When badges are added to **md-badges**, they will be added accordingly to this package in future releases.

# Styling

* ```ansi-colors``` is the main coloring package used in mdbadges-cli. Almost all text is colored using the ```c``` prefix. See some examples below:

```javascript
// coloring the whole message
console.log(c.yellow('Hasn\'t opened in your browser? Try clicking on the link below:'));
console.log(c.magenta(`https://github.com/inttter/${packageInfo.name}/releases/latest`));

// different colors within the same message
console.log(c.cyan(`Try running ${c.blue.bold(`mdb search`)} for a full list of badges in this category.`,));

// template literals with ansi-colors
name: ${c.green(formattedBadge)} in ${c.yellow(formattedCategory)}
```

<br>

* ```gradient-string``` is used for prompts to the user. Specifically, ```gradient.fruit``` is used for all prompt messages, such as this example below:

```javascript
const answers = await inquirer.prompt([
  {
    type: 'list',
    name: 'category',
    message: gradient.fruit('Select a category:'), // this will have the gradient
    choices: categories.map(formatCategoryName),
    },
  ]);
```

<br>

* ```Chalk``` is used for badge code outputs, such as this example below:

```javascript
console.log(c.green.bold('Badge found:'));
console.log(chalk.hex("#FFBF00")(selectedBadge)); // this is colored with hex #FFBF00
```

## Spellchecking

> [!NOTE]
> This also applies to the [**Spellcheck (JavaScript**)](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/spellcheck-js.yml) workflow.

```cspell``` is used for spell-checking Markdown files. There's a workflow within this repository which checks for spelling errors after any push/pull request to a Markdown file, which you can see [**here**](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/spellcheck.yml).

You can see the ```cspell``` config in the ```cspell.json``` file [**here**](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/blob/main/cspell.json).

To avoid any spelling errors when writing new documentation/code, it's recommended to run this command:

```bash
cspell '**'
```

This will check for spelling mistakes in most files. If you spot any extra spelling mistakes outside of the file you're editing, you are free to edit those too!

Here's an example of two scenarios:

|    ```cspell``` ***spotting*** spelling mistakes                              | ```cspell``` finding ***no mistakes***                                   |

> [!NOTE]
> In certain cases, the workflow may fail. For example, if I removed `"shieldsio",` from the `words` category in the config file, the workflow will fail, and the following will appear:
>
> ```bash
> ~ cspell '**/*.md'
>
> ... # other files...
>
> 2/3 .\CONTRIBUTING.md 45.50ms X
> .\CONTRIBUTING.md:141:74 - Unknown word (shieldsio) 
>
> ... # other files...
>
> CSpell: Files checked: 3, Issues found: 1 in 1 file
> ```
>
> In the case above, if it is not a typo and it is, in fact, a correct word/phrase/etc., you can add it to the `words` category in `cspell.json`. After doing this, you can commit this change to your branch, and the workflow should run without problems.


# Committing

* mdbadges-cli uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages, so commit messages should be in this format:

    ```
    chore: remove old code
    ```

* [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) is used for (most) commit emoji's, as well as some others (which you can decide what they should be). For example:

    ```
    ‚ú® feat: add GitHub badge
    ```

For more specific things, you can do something like the following examples below:

```
üîñ chore(release): bump version to 6.0.0

‚ú® feat(update): show update progress bar

üêõ fix(badges): fix incorrect GitHub badge code
```
