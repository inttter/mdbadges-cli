# 👎 The Problem

Badges have become useful parts of documentation, whether it's to display information, promote, or anything else.

However, there isn't a way to access them from the command line. Some people don't feel like going onto Google, and typing **"youtube shieldsio badge"**, then copying ➜ pasting, because of how time consuming it is.

# ✅ The Solution?

To make a command line tool to access a bunch of different badges, so that you ***don't*** have to leave your terminal, saving yourself some time in the process.

# ✨ Features

* 🤏 Small in size to install ─ **about ~200KB gzipped**

* 👥 A **wide range** of over 400+ badges to explore from

* 🎨 **5** supported Shields.io styles to choose from

* ✏️ Choose to use **Markdown** or **HTML** in supported commands 

* 🔎 Over **30+** categories to search from ─ more variety!

* 😎 Easily create your **custom** badges with just simple prompts

* 🎲 Generate a badge **at random** ─ supports **Markdown** and **HTML**

* 🩳 Convenient **aliases** for most commands
