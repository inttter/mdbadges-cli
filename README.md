# Usage: 

### To find a badge:

```
mdb <category> <badgeName>

e.g. | mdb browser firefox
```

Result: [![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-FF7139?logo=Firefox&logoColor=white)](#)

If a badge is found in that category, it will output the required Markdown.

---

‚ú® **2.0.0+** | To find HTML, add ```--html``` after ```mdb```:

```
mdb --html <category> <badgeName>

e.g. | mdb --html work-and-jobs upwork
```

**Result:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Upwork-6FDA44?logo=upwork&logoColor=fff" />

---

‚ú® **2.1.0+** | To customise the style of the badge , add ```--style``` after your original command:

```
mdb <category> <badgeName> --style <style>

e.g. | mdb programming-language javascript --style for-the-badge
```
**Result:** [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=000&style=for-the-badge)](#)

---

### To search for badges in a specific category:

```
mdb search <category>

e.g. | mdb search browser
```

or
```
mdb find

e.g. | mdb find package-managers
```


**Result:** <!-- both commands (search and find) do the same thing and will have the same output. the screenshot simply displays the command when being ran as mdb search !-->

![Search Command](assets/search.png)

This command will display the badges available in that category, and you can then type the command above with a valid category and badge name to display the Markdown.

You can also do the shorter version of this command:

```
mdb s <category>

e.g. | mdb s package-managers
```
**Result:** 

![Shortened Version of Command](assets/search-shortened.png)

---

### To search for badges based on a certain keyword/query:

```
mdb lookup <keyword>

e.g. | mdb lookup git
```

This command will look for certain badges using the specified keyword and output the available badges.

---

### To view the full list of badges from the command line, do:

```
mdb badges
```

Alternatively, you can visit the following two links without doing the command:

https://github.com/inttter/md-badges

https://docs.inttter.com/content/badges

---

### To check for updates:

```
mdb update
```

This command uses Axios to determine if your package version is out-of-date.

You can also do the shortened version of this command:

```
mdb upd
```

---

### To view the list of available commands from the command line:

```
mdb help
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use ```-h``` after typing ```mdb``` to view the shortened commands.

---

### To view the (current) list of categories in the command line:

```
mdb categories
```
or
```
mdb cat
```

This command displays the list of current badge categories in the command line.

> [!NOTE]
> When typing a category name that has a space, make sure to include a ```-``` in the place of the space.

---

### To create your own badge with custom parameters:

```
mdb create
```

This command will let you create the...
* Alt Text
* Name
* Color
* Logo
* Style

...of the badge.

Here's an example of how you could create a GitHub badge with the ```for-the-badge``` style.

![Creating a Badge](assets/create.png)

**Result:** [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-%23000000?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to replace **(#)** with the URL that you'd like the badge to lead to when clicked on.
>
> In the example above, it leads to the GitHub website.

---

### To generate a random badge:

```
mdb random
```
and
```
mdb r
```

This command will output a random badge, in both its Markdown and HTML format.

---

### To view information about this package:
```
mdb about
```

---

### To copy a badge to the clipboard:

```
mdb copy <category> <badgeName>
```
