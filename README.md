[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/inttter/mdbadges-cli/test.yml?branch=main&colorA=18181B&colorB=07B0D1&logo=github&logoColor=959DA5&label=Tests)](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml "The testing workflow.")

# Getting Started

To start using a command, add the ```mdb``` prefix, followed by the [**command name/syntax**](#commands). 

For example:

```bash
mdb social discord

# Badge found:
# [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](#)
```

If you want to use a prefix, such as ```--style```, you can run the same command with the prefix after it (prefixes have -- or - before them). 

For example:

```bash
mdb social discord --style plastic

# Badge found:
# [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=plastic)](#)
```
