[![Release](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
[![CI](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inttter/mdbadges-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Getting Started

To start using a command, add the `mdb` prefix, followed by the correct [command name and syntax](#commands). For example:

```bash
mdb social discord

# Badge found:
# [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](#)
```

If you want to use a option, such as `--style`, you can run the same command with the option placed after it. For example:

```bash
mdb social discord --style plastic

# Badge found:
# [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-%235865F2.svg?&logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=plastic)](#)
```

For information on things like command syntax or accepted arguments, run `mdb help`.
