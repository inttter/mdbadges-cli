This folder holds custom JavaScript files for certain commands, as it won't fit with the other root directory files.

I don't intend on hosting every command here, as that will greatly increase the package size. This is just to keep the package file structure organised *(enough)* and to make it easy to incoorporate into the main ```index.js``` file.
